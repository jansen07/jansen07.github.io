I have one goal, that is to be able to get back to development and find a remote job so that I can have my feet back
to pure development. For the past 2 years, I have been working with other departments to create new integrations/solve critical issues and handling/training members
so they are equipped in dealing with tickets and development. These led to fewer time in working directly with codes. As you move up the ladder, the time for actual code
decreases as you are prioritizing other people management tasks and other important issues and goals.

I am currently reading Java 17 books to refresh my knowledge in Java back from square zero.
I am great at solving problems and writing clean code, I just need some refreshers.

There are times that I may feel down or hopeless but I will not surrender. I am me and I know that few years ago, I am
expert in writing clean codes specially in Java. Since Mulesoft is almost all GUI except some XML when you need to format
the lines, I kind of miss writing codes in pure letters and having that sense of writing a project like an `Art.`

In the next few days/weeks, I will be back on my feet. If I get hired, I will be grateful and give all my energy to this company.
