### If you are a leader, how would you handle your subordinate leaders and members?  
<br>
### *The Leader*
One time I've read message of a good leader saying  like.  

"Good morning all , I hope everyone is ok.  
Your heads will be reaching out to you this morning as Iâ€™d like to ensure everyone is ok.  
......"  
  
For me I think it's a good characteristics of a leader.  
Caring for your subordinates/members, it reflects how thoughtful you are.  
  <br>
on the other side of the story....  

#### *The Heads*  
  <br>
The subordinate heads will ask the members if they are okay.  
Members knows that it was a command from his/her lead.  
<br>
The leader already took all the rewards and seems like nothing was left to his/her heads.  
 
 <br>

>A great Leader  teaches people the skills and letting them experience how it feels.
