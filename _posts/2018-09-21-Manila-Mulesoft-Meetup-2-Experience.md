#### Topic: Mule 4

It was my second time attending mulesoft meetup now and the experience is getting more exciting.   
Attending this meetup boosts my hype and enthusiasm on learning and mastering this technology.  
It will make you feel that there are lots of mule developers out there just like me who integrates cloud services.  


<br>
In this blog I will share to you my experiences on the event happened at WhiteSky Labs last September 20,2018  
<br>
Last night(September 20) was a great experience. We learned a lot on what's new on Mule 4 and their advantages. The attendees shared their ideas on advantages on using mule 4 and what are the breaking changes that you have to watchout for.

The speaker showed us the features and changes on mule 4 and their syntax.
One of the examples that I like is the dataweave 2.0 where you can now call java methods inside dataweave.

Muleys also received exciting prices during that day.
The organizers gave 2 vouchers to those who've answered the questions correctly
These  vouchers can be used for mulesoft training or certification.
I really hoped that my name was drawn out of that box though ( ðŸ˜‚ )
but that's okay. all mulesoft attendees got their free Mule Shirts!

They also gave 2 Mule Squishy to the first timer who won the game Mule Genius ( Pinoy Henyo )
I participated on that game though ðŸ˜‚ it was fun.
